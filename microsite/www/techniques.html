	<h1> TECHNIQUES </h1>
	<p class="whatisit">
Because reptiles and amphibians are often agitated when captured, various techniques have evolved to pacify subjects of herpetological photography. One technique involves placing a hat or similar object over an animal (typically a snake) so that it coils and rests quietly. The object is then quickly lifted off the animal and a series of photos are taken. Assistants are often standing by out-of-frame to head off escape attempts.[7]

Many techniques are used when a person goes “herping” or looking for reptiles and amphibians. One technique is known as road running, road cruising, or cruising. This is done by riding in a vehicle and traveling down stretches of road at a slow speed to count or catch animals. The use of a road as a natural transect can generate estimates of species density by cruising the road at peak migration time.[8] Similarly, driving roads at night during anuran breeding times can yield a high diversity of species. The North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP) uses road surveys to log a species count into a data base to study amphibian population across the nation. This is done by traveling down a set route and stopping at predetermined spots and listening for a few minutes and writing down every species that was heard at that location. (Dodd 2010)[9]

Another technique for observing reptiles for research or photo opportunities is the use of cover boards. Silvy (2012)[10] suggests that the use of metal and wood cover boards be set at least two months prior to searching. These boards act like natural cover for herpetofauna to hide.

Tree frogs can be caught and photographed by using PVC pipes that are capped on the bottom and hung vertically in a tree near water.[10] If aquatic species are the target species the use of an aquatic funnel trap can be used.[10] Drift fences have been used with a high success rate for capturing snakes. The use of a drift fences along with a pit-fall or funnel box trap has yielded high success. The length of the fence is variable, but the longer the fence results in a higher success rate. The fence is set with traps in the middle and/or the ends. Snakes encounter the fence and are directed or lead to the trap. Care must be taken in providing enough cover so the species do not die of heat exhaustion. Identifying all the species in the trap is recommended so an accidental envenomation is avoided. Pit fall traps are small buckets that are placed in holes dug out next to the drift fence.[10]

Turtles can be caught by using a variety of techniques; hoop traps, basking traps, floating pitfall traps, and funnel traps are among the best traps to use. Basking traps are used to catch basking turtles. These traps float on the surface and have an elevated platform for the turtle to bask. The net is underwater so they cannot escape once they fall into the trap
