		<li> Lauren Jin, Communication Design, Junior</li>
		<li> Web/APP design is an integral part of being a Communication Design major. Thus, learning the basics of HMTL/CSS seemed extremely neccessary.</li>
		<li> I have no experience with HMTL or CSS </li>
		<li> I hope to be able to translate prototypes from Sketch, XD, Figma into actual functioning websites or apps </li>
		<li> When considering the differences between print and web, though there are similarities, the differences vary vastly. With print, you constantly have to account for the physical interaction between paper and the human eye. For example, there is continuous testing and printing out of typography. With web/screen design, there are even more factors to consider. For example how does one page flow into another or what does a link do when you click on it. </li>
		<li>https://www.headspace.com/ Headspace has an extremely cohesive brand design. The website is clearly designed and effectively uses elements of hierarchy, scale, color, and contrast. </li>
		<li> https://www.apple.com/ Apples website exemplifies effective communication through using clear headers in an organized way. The information is not chaotic or hard to process at all. </li>
		<li> https://www.ogilvy.com/ Ogilvy's website is the perfect balance between good design and good communication. It is visually pleasing to look at and clearly illustrates what messages they are trying to convey. </li>
